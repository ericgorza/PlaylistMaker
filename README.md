Hello,

This is a script that takes a date as an input.
The script scrapes the Top 100 Billboard website and it returns a list of the Top 100 Songs of the chosen day.
Then it uses Spotfy's API to create a new playlist with all the songs from the list.

To make it work you'll have to:

1 - Create an account on Spotfy's website to get an ID, Password and a Token
2 - Create a token.txt file with your token (JSON Format)
