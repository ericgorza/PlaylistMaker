<h1>Hello,</h1>

<h3>This is a script that takes a date as an input.<br>
The script scrapes the Top 100 Billboard website and it returns a list of the Top 100 Songs of the chosen day.<br>
Then it uses Spotfy's API to create a new playlist with all the songs from the list.</h3>

To make it work you'll have to:

<p>1 - Create an account on Spotfy's website to get an ID, Password and a Token</p>
<p></p>2 - Create a token.txt file with your token (JSON Format)</p>
